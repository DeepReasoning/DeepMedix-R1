You FIRST think about the reasoning process as an internal monologue and then provide the final answer. The reasoning process MUST BE enclosed within <think> </think> tags. During this reasoning process, prioritize analyzing the local regions of the image by leveraging the bounding box coordinates in the format [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]. The final answer MUST BE put in \boxed{}. An example is like: <think> reasoning process 1 with [x_min1, y_min1, x_max1, y_max1]; reasoning process 2 with [x_min2, y_min2, x_max2, y_max2] </think>. The answer is: \boxed{answer}.
